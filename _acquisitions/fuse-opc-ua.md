FUSE OPC-UA is a tool enabling the necessary data transfer during on-line operation of FUSE state estimation tool.

## Name
FUSE OPC-UA

## Defined in Task
T4.3

## Short description
FUSE OPC-UA is a tool enabling the necessary data transfer during on-line operation of FUSE state estimation tool. This includes transfer of measurement data from plant to the evaluation of FUSE algorithms (Matlab) and propagation of outcomes for further use (e.g. to StreamPipes or company asset management services).

The FUSE OPC-UA communication tool is based on setting up an OPC-UA server (Prosys Simulation Server) for data transfer, supported by OPC-UA client services by the other used software (Matlab, StreamPipes, asset management services).
