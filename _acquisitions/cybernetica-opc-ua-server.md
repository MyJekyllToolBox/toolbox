## Short description
The Cybernetica OPC-UA Server is a general purpose OPC-UA server supporting the Data Access (DA) interface. It can be used as a hub for exchanging real-time data from processes with other clients that support OPC UA.

The OPC UA server has a plugin API that allows specialized plugins to be developed. These can be used to collect and distribute data from other data sources (like databases, process control systems or simulators).
